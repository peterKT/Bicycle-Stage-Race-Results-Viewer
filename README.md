# Bicycle_Stage_Race_Results_Viewer
With these tools, publicly available GC (general classification) results for major bicycle stage races like the Tour de France can be re-formatted to display interesting details about movement up and down the standings as they occur--sometimes dramatically--each day. The user will need to copy and paste such results into text files (not too hard!). The rest is handled by command-line perl scripts that quickly rip through the text files and prepare the results for permanent viewing. Requires Linux, Perl, MySQL and an office app like LibreOffice for making the text files.

See the Wiki for details on using.
